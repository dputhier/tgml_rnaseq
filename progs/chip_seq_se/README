## Running the workflow (without the scheduler/batch job management system)

### edit the config.json

Replace "/Users/puthier/tmp/dp_worflows" by the path to the dp_worflows directory on your machine.
 	- emacs snakefiles/config.json
	  - change: "workingdir": "/Users/puthier/tmp/dp_worflows",


### Change dir

Go to dp_worflows/progs/chip_seq_se


### Start the WF


    - snakemake -s snakefiles/Snakefile.py


### Notes

You will end up with lot of errors as the workflow needs several tools and has no rule/target/step for installation... Sorry.
